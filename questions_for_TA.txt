1. We get 100 % novel, unique, novel and unique for the 1000 graphs generated with the baseline ER. Is that OK? I guess it's not unreasonable. 
2. Should we compare average node degrees or just node degrees?
3. How do we choose the number of nodes N in a sampled graph? Sample from the empirial distribution?
4. How good results can we expect from an end-to-end model? Is it OK to do quite a lot of post-processing of the generated graphs?
5. Can we use other people's Github repositories for the generative model?
